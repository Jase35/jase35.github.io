    "about": "I am a software engineering student attending Iowa State University. Currently, I am a junior who has acheived 87/125 credit hours for the program, so I am quite a bit ahead. Even prior to my enrollment, I have years of experience programming, dating back to when I was only thirteen years of age. I developed an obsession with digital circuitry, and from that I attempted to construct microcontrollers, and from that I learned to code.",
    "mission": "I have strong individual and voluntary convictions to serve the overall benefit of my community and company, through industriousness, constitution, and personal accountability. In every group environment, I communicate with my peers the \"who,\" \"what,\" and \"when\" of each task, for the sake of expediting the workflow, as I reject the notion that efficiency and quality are somehow mutually exclusive. Rather; they are compounded in the higher productivity of labor, allowing the heightened profit of each individual.",
